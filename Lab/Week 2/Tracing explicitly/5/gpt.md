Alright, let’s break this down carefully — this one has **local variable shadowing, post/pre increments, instance variables**, and method calls that modify the state.

---

## **Step 0 – Initial State**

For both new objects, Java gives **instance variables** default values:

```
temp = 4
sum  = 0
y    = 0
x    = 0
```

---

## **Step 1 – main() first call**

```java
A t1 = new A();  // t1: temp=4, sum=0, y=0, x=0
t1.methodA(5);
```

---

### **Inside t1.methodA(5)**

Local variables:

```
m = 5
n = {2, 5}
x (local) = 0
```

First statement:

```java
y = m + this.methodB(x++, m) + (temp++);
```

1. **x++** (local `x`): passes 0 to `methodB`, then local `x` becomes 1.
   Call:

   ```
   this.methodB(0, 5)
   ```

---

#### **Inside t1.methodB(0, 5)**

Local vars:

```
m = 0
n = 5
```

Steps:

1. `y = 4 + this.y + m;` → `y = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4` (**local y**, not the field).
2. `x = this.y + y + (++temp) - n;`

   * `this.y` = 0 (instance var)
   * `y` (local) = 4
   * `++temp`: temp = 5 (pre-increment)
     So: `x = 0 + 4 + 5 - 5 = 4` (**instance var `x` becomes 4**)
3. `sum = x + y + this.sum;` → `sum = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8` (**instance sum** = 8)
4. Print:

```
y + " " + this.x + " " + sum
4 4 8
```

Return:

```
return x; // returns 4
```

---

#### **Back to methodA**

After `methodB`:

* Return value = 4
* Local `x` = 1 (from earlier post-increment)
* **t1 fields now**: `temp = 5`, `sum = 8`, `y = 0` (instance y still unchanged by methodB because it used local y), `x = 4`

Now:

```
y = m + 4 + (temp++);
```

* m = 5
* temp++ = 5 (post-increment, then temp becomes 6)

`y = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14` (**instance y = 14**)

---

Next:

```java
x = this.x + 2 + n[0];
```

* this.x = 4 (instance var)
* n\[0] = 2

So: `x (local) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8`

---

Next:

```java
sum = sum + x + y;
```

* sum (instance) = 8
* x (local) = 8
* y (instance) = 14

`sum = 8 + 8 + 14 = 30` (**instance sum = 30**)

---

Next:

```java
n[0] = sum + 2; // 30 + 2 = 32
```

Print:

```
n[0] + " " + x + " " + sum
32 8 30
```

---

**Output so far:**

```
4 4 8
32 8 30
```

---

## **Step 2 – main() second call**

```java
A t2 = new A();  // fresh object: temp=4, sum=0, y=0, x=0
t2.methodB(12, 2);
```

---

### **Inside t2.methodB(12, 2)**

Local vars:

```
m = 12
n = 2
```

1. `y = 4 + this.y + m;` → `y = 4 + 0 + 12 = 16` (**local y**)
2. `x = this.y + y + (++temp) - n;`

   * this.y = 0
   * y (local) = 16
   * ++temp: temp = 5
     So: `x = 0 + 16 + 5 - 2 = 19` (**instance x = 19**)
3. `sum = x + y + this.sum;` → `sum = 19 + 16 + 0 = 35` (**instance sum = 35**)
4. Print:

```
16 19 35
```

---

## **Final Output**

```
4 4 8
32 8 30
16 19 35
```

---

If you want, I can **make a clean, formatted trace table** showing each variable (local vs. instance) at each step — that would make it crystal clear why `this.y` stayed `0` in `methodB` and why `temp` ended up incrementing the way it did. Would you like me to prepare that table?
