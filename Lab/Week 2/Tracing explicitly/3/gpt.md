Alright — let's walk through this **step-by-step** so you can see exactly how references and object fields change.

---

## **Class**

```java
public class Student {
    public String name;
    public double cgpa;
}
```

---

## **Step-by-step trace**

### **Initial creation**

```java
Student s1 = new Student();  // s1 → new Student {name=null, cgpa=0.0}
Student s2 = new Student();  // s2 → new Student {name=null, cgpa=0.0}
Student s3 = null;           // s3 → null
```

---

### **Set s1's values**

```java
s1.name = "Student One";  // s1.name = "Student One"
s1.cgpa = 2.3;            // s1.cgpa = 2.3
```

Now:

```
s1 → {name="Student One", cgpa=2.3}
s2 → {name=null, cgpa=0.0}
s3 → null
```

---

### **Assign s3 to s1**

```java
s3 = s1; // s3 now refers to the SAME object as s1
```

Both `s1` and `s3` → same object:

```
s1 ↘
s3 ↗  {name="Student One", cgpa=2.3}
s2    {name=null, cgpa=0.0}
```

---

### **Set s2's values using s3's cgpa**

```java
s2.name = "Student Two";           // s2.name = "Student Two"
s2.cgpa = s3.cgpa + 1;              // s3.cgpa = 2.3, so s2.cgpa = 3.3
```

Now:

```
s1/s3 → {name="Student One", cgpa=2.3}
s2     → {name="Student Two", cgpa=3.3}
```

---

### **Change s3's name (affects s1 too)**

```java
s3.name = "New Student";
```

Since s3 and s1 refer to the same object:

```
s1/s3 → {name="New Student", cgpa=2.3}
s2     → {name="Student Two", cgpa=3.3}
```

---

### **First set of prints**

```java
System.out.println(s1.name); // "New Student"
System.out.println(s2.name); // "Student Two"
System.out.println(s3.name); // "New Student"
System.out.println(s1.cgpa); // 2.3
System.out.println(s2.cgpa); // 3.3
System.out.println(s3.cgpa); // 2.3  (same as s1)
```

**Output so far:**

```
New Student
Student Two
New Student
2.3
3.3
2.3
```

---

### **Make s3 point to s2**

```java
s3 = s2;  // Now s3 refers to s2's object
```

Now:

```
s1 → {name="New Student", cgpa=2.3}
s2/s3 → {name="Student Two", cgpa=3.3}
```

---

### **Change names**

```java
s1.name = "old student";     // affects only s1
s2.name = "older student";   // affects both s2 and s3
s3.name = "oldest student";  // changes s2.name (and s3.name, same object)
```

Now:

```
s1 → {name="old student", cgpa=2.3}
s2/s3 → {name="oldest student", cgpa=3.3}
```

---

### **Change s2's cgpa**

```java
s2.cgpa = s1.cgpa - s3.cgpa + 4.5;
        = 2.3     - 3.3     + 4.5
        = -1.0 + 4.5
        = 3.5
```

Now:

```
s1 → {name="old student", cgpa=2.3}
s2/s3 → {name="oldest student", cgpa=3.5}
```

---

### **Second set of prints**

```java
System.out.println(s1.name); // old student
System.out.println(s2.name); // oldest student
System.out.println(s3.name); // oldest student
System.out.println(s1.cgpa); // 2.3
System.out.println(s2.cgpa); // 3.5
System.out.println(s3.cgpa); // 3.5
```

**Output for second set:**

```
old student
oldest student
oldest student
2.3
3.5
3.5
```

---

## **Final Output (full program)**

```
New Student
Student Two
New Student
2.3
3.3
2.3
old student
oldest student
oldest student
2.3
3.5
3.5
```

If you want, I can make you a **diagram showing all three references and how they point to the objects at each step** — it makes this reference behavior much easier to visualize. That’s usually the trickiest part for beginners.
