## Main Method Execution

```java
TracingProblem t1 = new TracingProblem();
```
- Calls the no-arg constructor of `TracingProblem` to create `t1`.
- Instance variables initialized:
  - `t1.temp = 4` (explicitly initialized)
  - `t1.x = 0` (default for `int`)
  - `t1.sum = 2` (explicitly initialized)

**No-arg Constructor Code:**
```java
this.x = 3;
sum += x;
temp --;
```

**Constructor execution line by line:**

```
Step 1: this.x = 3
        t1.x = 3

Step 2: sum += x
        t1.sum = 2 + 3 = 5

Step 3: temp --
        t1.temp = 4 - 1 = 3
```

**State after constructor:**
- `t1.temp = 3`
- `t1.x = 3`
- `t1.sum = 5`

```java
TracingProblem t3 = new TracingProblem();
```
- Calls the no-arg constructor to create `t3`.
- Initializes:
  - `t3.temp = 4`
  - `t3.x = 0`
  - `t3.sum = 2`

**Constructor execution:**

```
Step 1: this.x = 3
        t3.x = 3

Step 2: sum += x
        t3.sum = 2 + 3 = 5

Step 3: temp --
        t3.temp = 4 - 1 = 3
```

**State after constructor:**
- `t3.temp = 3`
- `t3.x = 3`
- `t3.sum = 5`

## methodA Call (t3.methodA(t1))

```java
t3.methodA(t1);
```
- Calls `methodA` on `t3` with parameter `t5` referencing `t1`.

**Current State:**
- `t1.temp = 3`
- `t1.x = 3`
- `t1.sum = 5`
- `t3.temp = 3`
- `t3.x = 3`
- `t3.sum = 5`

**methodA Code:**
```java
int x = 1;
methodB(this);
this.temp = t5.temp + x;
this.x = x + (++sum);
sum = sum + this.x;
System.out.println(this.x + " " + temp + " " + sum);
```

**methodA execution line by line:**

```
Step 1: int x = 1
        Local variable x = 1 (shadows t3.x)

Step 2: methodB(this)
        Calls methodB(t3) (this refers to t3)
```

## Nested methodB Call (t3.methodB(t3))

**Inside methodB(TracingProblem t1):**
- Parameter: `t1` references `t3` (same object).

**Current State:**
- `t1.temp = 3`
- `t1.x = 3`
- `t1.sum = 5`
- `t3.temp = 3`
- `t3.x = 3`
- `t3.sum = 5`

**methodB Code:**
```java
this.temp = t1.temp + t1.x;
this.x = t1.sum + sum;
t1.x += this.x;
System.out.println(this.x + " " + this.temp + " " + t1.x);
```

**methodB execution line by line:**

```
Step 1: this.temp = t1.temp + t1.x
        t3.temp = 3 + 3 = 6 (t1 is t3)

Step 2: this.x = t1.sum + sum
        t3.x = 5 + 5 = 10 (t1.sum and this.sum are t3.sum)

Step 3: t1.x += this.x
        t3.x = 10 + 10 = 20 (t1 is t3)

Step 4: Print "20 6 20" (this.x, this.temp, t1.x)
        this.x is 20 (after Step 3), this.temp is 6, t1.x is 20
```

**State after methodB:**
- `t3.temp = 6`
- `t3.x = 20`
- `t3.sum = 5`
- `t1.temp = 3`
- `t1.x = 3`
- `t1.sum = 5`

**Back to methodA:**

```
Step 3: this.temp = t5.temp + x
        t3.temp = 3 + 1 = 4 (t5 is t1, local x = 1)

Step 4: this.x = x + (++sum)
        t3.sum = 5 + 1 = 6 (pre-increment)
        t3.x = 1 + 6 = 7 (local x = 1)

Step 5: sum = sum + this.x
        t3.sum = 6 + 7 = 13

Step 6: Print "7 4 13" (this.x, temp, sum)
```

**State after methodA:**
- `t1.temp = 3`
- `t1.x = 3`
- `t1.sum = 5`
- `t3.temp = 4`
- `t3.x = 7`
- `t3.sum = 13`

## Final Output
The program produces the following output:
```
20 6 20
7 4 13
```

## Final State Summary
- **t1**:
  - `t1.temp = 3`
  - `t1.x = 3`
  - `t1.sum = 5`
- **t3**:
  - `t3.temp = 4`
  - `t3.x = 7`
  - `t3.sum = 13`
