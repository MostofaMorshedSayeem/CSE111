Alright — I’ll trace this like we’ve done before, using a **clear step-by-step table** showing:

* **Local vars** (`x`, `y`, `p`, `n` inside methods)
* **Instance vars** (`this.p`, `this.y`, `this.sum`)
* The state **before and after** each important statement.

---

## **Initial State (before any method calls)**

When `t1` is created:

| Var      | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| this.p   | 3     |
| this.y   | 2     |
| this.sum | 0     |

---

## **Call 1: t1.methodA()**

**Inside methodA()**
Local: `x = 0`, `y = 0` (local shadows instance y)

1. `y = y + this.y;`
   → `y = 0 + 2 = 2` (local y = 2)
   Instance vars unchanged.

2. `x = sum + 2 + p;`
   → `x = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5` (local x = 5)

3. `sum = x + methodB(p, y) + this.y;`

   * `p` (param) = 3
   * `y` (local) = 2
     Calls: `methodB(3, 2)`

---

### **Inside methodB(3, 2)**

Local: `p = 3`, `n = 2`, `x = 0`

1. `y = this.y + (++p);`

   * `this.y` = 2 (instance)
   * `++p` → p = 4, so:
     `y (instance) = 2 + 4 = 6` (**instance y updated to 6**)

2. `x = x + 2 + n;` → `x = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4` (local x = 4)

3. `sum = sum + x + y;`

   * sum = 0
   * x (local) = 4
   * y (instance) = 6
     → `sum = 0 + 4 + 6 = 10` (**instance sum = 10**)

4. Print:

   ```
   4 6 10
   ```

5. `return sum;` → returns `10`

---

### **Back to methodA**

Now:
`sum = x + methodB(...) + this.y`
\= `5 + 10 + 6 = 21` (**instance sum = 21**)

4. Print:

```
5 2 21
```

---

**State after Call 1:**

| Var      | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| this.p   | 3     |
| this.y   | 6     |
| this.sum | 21    |

---

## **Call 2: t1.methodA()**

Local: `x = 0`, `y = 0`

1. `y = y + this.y;` → `y = 0 + 6 = 6` (local y)

2. `x = sum + 2 + p;` → `x = 21 + 2 + 3 = 26` (local x)

3. `sum = x + methodB(p, y) + this.y;`

   * Call: `methodB(3, 6)`

---

### **Inside methodB(3, 6)**

Local: `p = 3`, `n = 6`, `x = 0`

1. `y = this.y + (++p);`

   * this.y = 6 (instance)
   * ++p → p = 4
     → `y (instance) = 6 + 4 = 10`

2. `x = x + 2 + n;` → `x = 0 + 2 + 6 = 8`

3. `sum = sum + x + y;`

   * sum = 21
   * x = 8
   * y = 10 (instance)
     → sum = 21 + 8 + 10 = 39 (instance sum)

4. Print:

```
8 10 39
```

5. Return: 39

---

### **Back to methodA**

`sum = x + 39 + this.y`
\= `26 + 39 + 10 = 75` (**instance sum = 75**)

Print:

```
26 6 75
```

---

**State after Call 2:**

| Var      | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| this.p   | 3     |
| this.y   | 10    |
| this.sum | 75    |

---

## **Call 3: t2.methodB(2, 3)**

`t2` is **new**, so instance vars reset:
`p = 3`, `y = 2`, `sum = 0`

Local: `p = 2`, `n = 3`, `x = 0`

1. `y = this.y + (++p);`

   * this.y = 2
   * ++p → p = 3
     → y (instance) = 2 + 3 = 5

2. `x = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5` (local)

3. `sum = 0 + 5 + 5 = 10` (instance sum)

4. Print:

```
5 5 10
```

Return 10.

---

## **Final Output in order**

```
4 6 10
5 2 21
8 10 39
26 6 75
5 5 10
10
```

---

If you want, I can also **draw the variable scope diagram** so you visually see which `y` is **local** vs **instance** — that would make the `this.y` updates obvious. Would you like me to prepare that?
